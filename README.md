Overarching story idea (for future development if desired):
You (the player) are the child of time travelers. You sneak into the workshop with the time machine to mess with it and you accidently send yourself back in time, and now with a broken time machine. You begin your journey back home in ancient egypt. Each time period has more tools and equipment to fix your time machine and get you one step closer to home. Each cirucit you build should allow for complete creativity over the design. Different designs should have the possibility to take you to different eras in time to create a very open exploration game. The game play style should be escape room where completing the circuit allows you to leave your current area. That could appear as walking through a door into a new time period, opening a door, starting a portal, etc.
